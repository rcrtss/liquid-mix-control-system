# Liquid mixture control system with Arduino UNO
Liquid mix control system simulating an industrial process replacing a PLC with an Arduino UNO and the necessary electronics for input and output interfaces.

# Introduction
Design of an embedded system with the objective of replacing the controller of the didactic liquid mixing station Festo MPS® PA, originally a PLC, with an Arduino UNO.

Developed in collaboration with other Mechatronics Engineering student at Universidad Anáhuac.
